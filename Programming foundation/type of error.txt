# Error types:
    - Compile time error (syntax error || semantic error)
    - Run time error
    - Logical error

- A compile-time error generally refers to the errors that correspond to the semantics or syntax.
- A runtime error refers to the error that we encounter during the code execution during runtime.
- Logical error refers to wrong coding logic.

- Write_code -> Compilation -> ByteCode -> Execution
- Write_code -> Translation|Execution

- Compilation vs Execution

- error detection during compilation
- error detection during interpretation
- error detection during runtime
- error detection by IDE.
