- compiler is a software program that transforms a program or code written in high-level-programming-language into low-level-machine readable-language.

- Compiler takes less time when it comes to execution. 
- Interpreter takes less time when it comes to translation. 

- Compiler catches error at then time of compilation/translation even before executing code.
- Interpreter catches error at then time of compilation/translation/execution.

- Compiler, first translates language and then we can execute the translated code.
- Interpreter translate and execute code at same time.

- Compilation vs Execution
